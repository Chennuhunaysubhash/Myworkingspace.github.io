            <h3> A USER-CENTRIC MACHINE LEARING FRAMEWORK FOR CYBER SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER</h3>

        <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
        <p id="matter">In order to ensure a company's Internet security, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system is in place to simplify the various preventive technologies and flag alerts for security events. Inspectors (SOC) investigate warnings to determine if this is true or not. However, the number of warnings in general is wrong with the majority and is more than the ability of SCO to handle all awareness. Because of this, malicious possibility. Attacks and compromised hosts may be wrong. Machine learning is a possible approach to improving the wrong positive rate and improving the productivity of SOC analysts. In this article, we create a user-centric engineer learning framework for the Internet Safety Functional Center in the real organizational context. We discuss regular data sources in SOC, their work flow, and how to process this data and create an effective machine learning system. This article is aimed at two groups of readers. <br><br>
The first group is intelligent researchers who have no knowledge of data scientists or computer safety fields but who engineer should develop machine learning systems for machine safety. The second groups of visitors are Internet security practitioners that have deep knowledge and expertise in Cyber Security, but do Machine learning experiences do not exist and I'd like to create one by themselves. At the end of the paper, we use the account as an example to demonstrate full steps from data collection, label creation, feature engineering, machine learning algorithm and sample performance evaluations using the computer built in the SOC production of Seyondike.
